# sport-de-lair

A translation into English of the the parts of the most recent edition
of Le Sport de l'Air that concern the construction of the Pou-du-Ciel,
1936 model.

Though the French version has been made freely available by Alain
Mignet, and there is an English translation of the 1934 version
broadly disseminated online, there is not at this point any legal
basis by which I can distribute this translation.  You may watch my
progress, however, like one staring over my shoulder in a caf√©.
